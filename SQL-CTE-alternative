Below is a SQL query that calls the same results as the SQL-subquery function, but as a less expensive CTE(Common Table Expression)

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id,first_name,last_name,city,country,total_paid_amount)
AS
  (SELECT A.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name,D.city,E.country,
  SUM(amount) AS total_paid_amount
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  GROUP BY A.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name,D.city,E.country
  HAVING city IN ('Cianjur','Acua','So_Leopoldo','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei',' Tianjin','Hami','Kanchrapara','Bhusawal')
  ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
HHAVING top_customer_count > 0
ORDER BY (all_customer_count) DESC
LIMIT 5
