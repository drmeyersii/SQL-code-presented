The SQL query below utilizes the previously joined dataset (see SQL-Joins) to subquery the country each of the top 5 customers are based within.

SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C. city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C. country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
  SELECT A.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name,D.city,E.country,
  COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  SUM(A.customer_id) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON C.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  GROUP BY A.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name,D.city,E.country
  HAVING city IN ('Cianjur','Acua','So_Leopoldo','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei,'Tianjin','Hami','Kanchrapara','Bhusawal')
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
HAVING top_customer_count > 0
ORDER BY (all_customer_count) DESC
